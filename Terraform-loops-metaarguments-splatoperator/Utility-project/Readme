Problem: 

- how to create a instance in each az zone in terraform
- How to check instance type is present in each AZ zone or not. -- give me the AZ list in particular region where by desired EC2 instance type is supported. 



# Determine which Availability Zones support your instance type
aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings --location-type availability-zone  --filters Name=instance-type,Values=t3.micro --region us-east-1 --output table
